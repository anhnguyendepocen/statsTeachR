This module has been lifted from my course materials for Statistical Modeling and Data Visualization, the second course in an applied methodological sequence for graduate students in Biostatistics at UMass-Amherst. It contains a set of slides on generalized linear models (specifically logistic regression) and a one-class competition/exercise.
