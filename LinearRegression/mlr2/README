This module has been lifted from my course materials for Statistical Modeling and Data Visualization, the second course in an applied methodological sequence for graduate students in Biostatistics at UMass-Amherst.

The full course website can be found here:

I have pasted in a markdown-based outline for the five classes contained in this module below:

### Class 14 (Mar 11): MLR non-parametric inference
_Activities_

* warm-ups (visualization critique)
* lecture: simulation and inference from resampling 
* permutation test lab ( [html](../assets/lectures/class14_permutationLab.html) | [source](../assets/lectures/class14_permutationLab.Rmd) )

_Homework_

* Start a new data analysis write-up, include a brief summary from the first round. 
* Add bootstrapped inference to the new write-up.

#### Class 15 (Mar 15): MLR diagnostics
