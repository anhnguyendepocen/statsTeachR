Description: This module was adapted from the Statistical Modeling and Data Visualization course at UMass-Amherst. This module provides materials for five classes on multiple linear regression targeted for upper-level undergraduate or entry-level graduate students. Topics covered: resampling and bootstrap inference in a regression context, regression diagnostics, model selection, and variable interactions. There are two quizzes included in this module, one lab exercise (on permutation tests), and a few files with code that students are encouraged to use and build off of.
