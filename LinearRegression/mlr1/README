This module has been lifted from my course materials for Statistical Modeling and Data Visualization, the second course in an applied methodological sequence for graduate students in Biostatistics at UMass-Amherst.

The full course website can be found here:

I have pasted in a markdown-based outline for the six classes below:

#### Class 7 (Feb 11): MLR interpretations
_Activities_

* warm ups: wits and wagers (15 min)
* small groups: collecting data on wits and wagers (10 min)
* homework update
* MLR coefficient interpretation and matrix notation (20 min)
* MLR example walk-through (15 min)

_Homework_

* Problem Set 1: Due __Tuesday, 2/25/2014__ (by the beginning of class)
* Add a fitted MLR to your dataset write-up. State the model, in equation form. Describe it in words. Interpret your fitted coefficients.

#### Class 8 (Feb 13): 
SNOW DAY, CLASS CANCELLED.

#### Class 9 (Feb 20): MLR estimation and notation 
_Activities_

* lecture: matrix formulation of MLR
* small groups: visualization crititque

_Homework_

* Problem Set 1: Due __Tuesday, 2/25/2014__ (by the beginning of class)
* &nbsp;

#### Class 10 (Feb 25): MLR collinearity
_Activities_

* wits and wagers CI exercise
* lecture: hat matrix, collinearity

_Homework_

* Problem Set 1: Due TODAY at beginning of class

#### Class 11 (Feb 27): MLR categorical variables
_Activities_

* Mid-semester course evaluations (25 min)
* lecture: MLR Categorical variables

_Homework_

* [Problem Set 2](ps2.html), Due Friday 3/7, 5pm. 

#### Class 12 (Mar 4): MLR inference and testing
_Activities_

* warm-ups
* lecture: MLR inference and testing (45 min)

_Homework_

* [Problem Set 2](ps2.html), Due Friday 3/7, 5pm.
* Include one global F test (with written interpretation) in your problem set 2 write-up.

#### Class 13 (Mar 6): MLR GLobal F Tests
_Activities_

* warm-ups: [vizualization critique](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004726) (15 min)
* lecture: MLR Global F Tests (15 min)
* [F-test lab](../assets/lectures/class13_globalTests.html)
* GitHub demo: forking and pull requests

_Homework_

* [Problem Set 2](pages/ps2.html), Due Friday 3/7, 5pm.
* Visualization assignment: Please dig through the scientific literature (no limit on the discipline, but I'd encourage you to look in the literature for your field) and find a paper that uses some form of multiple linear regression models. The paper should be about modeling a continuous outcome (no logistic/log-linear/etc.. models) and could incorporate some more fancy modeling things than we've talked about (e.g. spline terms, polynomials, random effects). The paper should have a figure/graphic in it that attempts to visualize features of the regression. Post a link to the paper on Piazza (either a URL or a PDF file), with a note about which graphic you think is most relevant to the discussion, and describe what tool(s) you used to find the paper (e.g. Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, ...). Feel free to comment/start discussion on papers that other students post, but everyone is expected to find their own paper. I'll choose one that we'll talk about in more detail on Tuesday.
