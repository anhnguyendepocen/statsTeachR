Modules for problem-based lesson plans with R

# What is teachr?

teachr is an R package focused on delivering high-quality, classroom-tested lesson plans for classes in statistics and statistical computing. teachr is comprised of problem-oriented learning ''modules'' that are ready to be adapted to your classroom setting with (hopefully) minimal retooling on your part. 

# Why use teachr?

I am developing teachr to faciliate the sharing of problem-oriented statistics curricula and lesson-plans. The vision is to have a standardized repository where teachrs can include 'modules'  that they have used to teach R in a classroom setting.

# What is a module?

We use the word ''module'' to refer to a self-contained set of learning exercises. A module might be designed to fit into one 50-minute class period. Or it might be designed with two weeks of in-class exercises and out-of-class assignments. We hope to have a searchable and sortable list of modules available soon.
