Version: v1.0
Description: This module contains information on the principles and practice of reproducible research with R. This module is the first module of the HPC series. This module was presented at a one day short course, Biostatistics in Practice: Research Training in High-Performance Computing with R, given at the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC) on Februrary 7, 2014. The topics covered in this module include: simulation, random number generation, resampling, generating data from a model, inference using normal approx. and simple linear regression, and simulation-based permutation tests.
Keywords:  HPC, high performance computing, reproducible, simulation, model, inference, regression, permutation, parallelization, parallel.
Depends: HPC Module 1 should be completed before HPC Module 2. 
Suggests: This module is suggested to be used with the HPC Series. This is the second of three modules of the HPC Series.
