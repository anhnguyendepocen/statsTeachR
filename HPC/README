This HPC Series was presented as a one day short course, Biostatistics in Practice: Research Training in High-Performance Computing with R, at the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC) on Februrary 7, 2014 and was taught by Nicholas Reich, Gregory Matthews, and Andrea Foulkes.



We would appreciate hearing from you if you end up using or adapting these notes for future workshops.


This series contains three modules:
Module 1: Principles of reproducible research with R; 
Module 2: Introduction to cluster computing with R; and
Module 3: Simulation and parallel computing with R.

It is suggested to present these modules in order. One might present this series in the following way:
1. Module 1 slides
2. Explore concepts
3. Break
4. Module 2 slides
5. Module 2 labs
6. Break
7. Module 3 slides
8. Explore concepts
