Description: This module contains information on cluster computing, specifically using MGHPCC. This module is the third module of the HPC series. This module was presented at a one day short course, Biostatistics in Practice: Research Training in High-Performance Computing with R, given at the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC) on Februrary 7, 2014. The topics covered in this module include: Parallel computing, cluster computing, MGHPCC and Umass Cluster, cluster workflow, using VPN, running in Batch mode, transferring data, and submitting a job.
Keywords:  HPC, high performance computing, batch, MGHPCC, cluster, parallel, vpn, job, transferring.
Depends: HPC Module 1 and 2 should be completed before HPC Module 3. 
Suggests: This module is suggested to be used with the HPC Series. This is the third of three modules of the HPC Series.
